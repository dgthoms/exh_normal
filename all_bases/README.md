# exh_normal/all_bases

Tarball of all normal bases of GF(2^n) over GF(2) for n = 2..29.

**Warning:** compressed with gzip -9, so I recommend getting a coffee while waiting for decompressing.

## How to read these files##
Output format: one basis per line
```
  [NTL GF(2) vector representative] \<complexity\>
```

The NTL default modulus (using NTL::BuildSparseIrred) is used for all n.
